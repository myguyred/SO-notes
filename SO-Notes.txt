:THRUST:
When you through the plane it creates it's thrust that slowly disapates over the corse of the flight.
The reason that it doesn't continue to slow down during the flight, is because it is also falling
"converting" potential energy into thrust as it falls.

:LIFT:
The lift comes from the diffrence in air preasure above and below the wing. This is caused by the shape
of the wing, known as the airfoil. Lift is proportional to the size of the wing and the square of the speed
of the plane.

:LIFT & DRAG:
Lift and drag help keep the plane in the air. Aditionally, thrust isn't necessarily needed in the middle
of a flight, altho it is needd to begin said flight.

:DICT:
Thrust - Pushes the plane forward
Drag - Opposes  the thrust ; Needed so the plane doesn't tilt upwards
Lift - Moves the plane upwards
Gravity - Pulls the plane downwards

--Thrust generates Drag.

:LIFT EQ:
L = .5 * Cl * r * V^2 * A

r = air density
V = velocity
A = wing area
Cl = lift coefficient

:IDEAS:
Make a plane that glides wiht a low center of mass and a high wing area. Low weight would be good but if 
it is heavy, that might work too.

:CALC:
Calculating Maneuvering Speed (Va)
Calculating Visual Descent Point (VDP)
Converting climb gradient from feet per nautical mile to feet per minute (FPM)
How far out to start descending (using a standard 3 degree glide path)
Rate of descent to track a glide slope (3 degree)
Descent rate to use from the final approach fix (FAF)
Calculate the climb gradient required to climb over an obstacle 

Calculating Velocity, Drag, Descent, Asecent

:EQ:
Velocity = d/t
d = distance
t = time in seconds

Acceleration
*Keep units in metric system
*Use kg for mass
*Use Newtons for force
Acceleration = m/2^2

Fnet = m * a
Fnet = total force
m = mass
a = acceleration
